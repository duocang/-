- <h3>5. Developing a data model</h3>
    - ==**Attribute, class, or relationship?**==
        - Here are some examples of questions to help you decide. Might I want to *select objects based on the value of an attribute?* If the answer is yes, consider introducing a class for that information(create a **grede** class). <br>我这里有一些案例可以帮助你做出决定。我是否可能会*根据一个属性的值去选择一个对象*？例如，你是否可能会根据**年级**去选择一个**球队**？如果是，考虑为该信息引入一个表（类）(一个年级表)。
        - *Am Ilikely now or in the future to store other data about this information?* For example, might I want to keep additional information about the captain: phone, address, and so on? If yes, consider introducing a class.<br>*我是否可能现在或则在未来需要存储该信息的其他数据。*比如，我是否准备保存**队长**的其他信息：**电话、地址等等**。如果想，考虑建立一个表（类）。
        - *Am I storing (or should I be storing) such information already?* For example, the information about a captain is the same or similar to infromation about members. Consider a relationship between existing class.  <br> 我是否正在（或则应该）存储这些信息？比如，队长的信息和队员的信息是很相似的。考虑在已经存在的表之间建立一个关系。
    - **==More than one relationship between two classes两表之间不止一个关系==**
        - Consider more than one relationship between two classes if there is different information involving both classes. For example, a member might **play** for a team, **captain** a team, **manage** a team, and so on. <br> 如果两表间都有不同的数据时就需要考虑多个关系。比如，一个**球员**可能**效力于**，**管理**，**带领**一个球队。
    - **==Consider self relationships自身关系==**
        - Objects of a class can be related to each other. For example, members *sponsor* other members, people are *parents* of other people. 表的对象之间可以相互关联。比如，**球员赞助其他球员**，**百姓是百姓的父母**。
    - **==Different routes between classes 表之间的不同路径==**
        - Check wherever there is a closed loop to see whether the same information is being stored more than once.<br>检测关系路径是否包含闭路以便发现相同的信息是否被存储了多次。
        - Check to ensure you are not inferring more than you should from a route; that is, look out for fan traps where a class is related to two other classes and there is a cardinality of Many at both outer ends.<br>检测仪确保你不会获取到你不应该得到的数据；即小心**Fan Trap**，一个表和两个其他表相关，关系外侧的两个类的集合都包含多个元素。
        - Check to ensure a path is available for all objects; that is look ourt for chasm traps(are there optional relationships along the route?).<br> 确保一条关系路径可以通向所有对象；即**Chasm trap**问题。
    - **==Information dependent on objects of more than two classes==**
        - Consider introducing a new class where you need to know about combinations of objects from three or more class simultaneously; for example, which member played for which team in which match? <br>当你需要同时从三个或以上的表中获取一个组合对象时，考虑引入一个新的表。比如，那个球员效力于某个球队，参加了某场比赛？
        - Any attributes inn the class must dependon particular combination of objects from *each* of the participating classes; such as, what do I need to know about a particular *member* playing on a particular *team* in a particular *match*?<br>一个新表中的任一个属性必须依赖*每一个*参与表的对象的特殊组合；比如，某个特定球员效力于某个特定的球队，参与了某场比赛，对此我需要了解什么？
        - Consider what information might be pertinent to two objects form *pairs* of the contributing classes; for example, what do I need to know about a particular member and a particular team *independent* of any match?<br> 考虑什么信息可能成为两个表之间的中心；比如，对于独立于球赛的一个特定球员和一个特定球队，我需要知道什么？
        
        
+ <h3>6. Generalization and specialization</h3>
    1. ==Situations when inheritance is a possibility include the following:==
        + If different objects have mutually exclusive values for some attributes (e.g, administrators have grades but technicians have dates), consider specialized subclasses.
        + When you think *this is like that except for...* conside subclasses
        + When two classes have a similar relationship with another class, consider a new generalized superclass (e.g, if both students and staff are assigned parking spaces, consider a generalized class for people).
    2. ==Before you use inheritance, make sure that==
        + you have not confused objects with subclasses (e.g, Rover is probably an object, Dog or Cat could be classes).
        + you have considered whether an association with a category class would be sufficient (e.g, Labrador and Corgi could be objects of a Breed calss, and each dog could be associated with a breed).
        + it is not just the value of an attribute that is different (e.g, don't consider inheritance becasue the fees for Labrador and Collie are different).
    3. ==Other considerations==
        + Classes that have subclasses should be abstrct, which means they will never have any objects. This allows the problem to be more readily extended.
        + Consider associations with roles when you come across the *my object is a member of both these classes* dilemma.
        + Don't introduce the complexity of inheritance unless the specialized data in the subclasses is important to the main objectives of the project.

- <h3>7. From data model to relational database design</h3>
    1. For each class, create a table<br>每一个类创建一个表
    2. For each attribute, create a field and choose an appropriate data type. Consider whetehr some attributes(e.g., address) should be split into severl fields <br>每一个属性创建一列兵选择合适的数据类型。考虑某些属性是否需要拆分（如地址）
    3. Think about whichh fields should be required to have a value <br>思考那些列需要有值
    4. Consider what constraints need to be placed on the values of fields. Possibly create a new domain if your database product supports this<br>思考那些约束应该作用于列的值。在数据库支持的情况下创建一个取值空间
    5. Choose a field or combination of fields as the primary key. Ask careful questions to ensure that the key fields will always have unique values. <br>选择一列或一个列的组合作为主键。确保主键的值永远保持唯一
    6. For each **Many-Many relationship**, insert a new intermediary class and ==two **1-many**== relationships <br>为每一个**多对多关系**的中间插入==两个一对多关系==
    7. For each 1-Many relationship, take the primary key field(s) from the table representing the class at the **1 end** and add this field(s) as a foreign key in the table representing the class at the **Many end**.<br> 在每一个一对多关系中，获得**“一”端**表格的**主键**，并将其添加到**“多”端**的表格中作为**外键**
    8. For a 1-1 relationship, put the foreign key in the table where it is most likely to have a value or where the attribute is most important<br> 针对一对一关系，在表格中用最不可能为空或最重要的属性做外键
    9. For compulsory relationships, add a constraint to the foreign key fields that they must not be null.<br> 针对强制关系，给外键添加约束使其不为空
    10. For inheritance (as an approximation), alter the model to have a 1-1 *is* a relationship between the parent and each child class. Creat tables and foreign keys as in point seven.  <br>针对继承（关系型数据库没有内置的继承概念；但却可以近似模拟），更改模型进而在父母和每一个孩子之间拥有一对一的“is”关系。之后按照第7点建表、设外键
